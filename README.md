# Project-Air-Quality-Monitor
This project comprised designing an Air Quality Monitor from scratch where Arduino Uno was used as microprocessor to interpret data from sensors and give output.

I built an interactive air-quality monitor from scratch (using microcontroller Arduino Uno) that can be safely used with kids. It was programmed in C and is capable of smoke and dust detection and based on current Air-Quality-Index and prompts the user to take necessary action.
